### Prerequisites
You will need:
- A discord account

Make sure that discordjs is installed in your chosen directory
```

Create a file called ```config.json```

Paste in it:
```
{
    "prefix": "!",
    "token": "",
    "uri": "",
    "currency": "ðŸŒŸ"
}
```
Prefix denotes the command prefix used for intializing commands through discord text channels

Token is where to paste the discord authorization token

uri is used for mongodb

currency is the emoji utilized for currency.
